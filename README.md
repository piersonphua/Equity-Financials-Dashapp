This is my first project and it aims to provide a visualization of a company's key financial metrics over time. It can be viewed in yearly or quarterly periods and only works for equities in the US stock market. The main contents are EARNINGS & REVENUE, PROFITABILITY, SOLVENCY & LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL HEALTH. Project1.pynb is the jupyter notebook file that has to be rerun to change the stock input. app.py is a dash application that shows an interactive dashboard to change the stock and yearly/quarterly inputs. The API used for this version is from financialmodelingprep.com

UPDATE:
Since the pricing changes to financialmodelingprep API, I have had to redo the entire site with another API. This time the API will be from simfin. Site functions are similar, formatting and color has changed slightly. I have also included a newsfeed for top headlines. 5/7/2020
