# dashapp
This is my first project and it aims to provide a visualization of a company's key financial metrics over time. It can be viewed in yearly or quarterly periods and only works for equities in the US stock market. The main contents are EARNINGS & REVENUE, PROFITABILITY, SOLVENCY & LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL HEALTH. Project1.pynb is the jupyter notebook file that has to be rerun to change the stock input. app.py is a dash application that shows an interactive dashboard to change the stock and yearly/quarterly inputs.
